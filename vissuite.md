## Settings<a name="settings"></a>

This section covers the functionality of the [visualization suite of the JBDB](https://network-studies.org/#!/vissuite/front) and the different ways these visualizations can be generated. When entering this view, you will be presented with the following settings page:

INSERT_SCREENSHOT

Broadly speaking, there are three important sections to the settings view: the first concerns the persons one is interested in visualizing (who to visualize?); the second is about what to base the visualizations on (what to visualize?); and then third is concerned with how the visualizations should look in the end (how to visualize?).

Tis section is therefore structured in a way to reflect these three broad questions.

### Who to visualize?<a name="who-to-visualize"></a>

The first settings section allows to select the persons to base the visualizations on in five different ways:

INSERT_SCREENSHOT

Apart from the the "All" setting, which visualizes all persons in the JBDB, the other options work as follows: you select persons either directly ("Select by name") or by source(s)/attribute; these _seed persons_ are then used to find all other persons with whom they are connected, and this final set of persons will be visualized.

Going through each option individually, this should become clear.

Choosing "Select by name" displays a search bar and two boxes. By searching for persons, the left box will be filled with the matching results.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> You can now either select individual persons by clicking on them or move all found persons to the right box by clicking the right arrow symbol. You can de-select persons by either clicking on them in the right box or by clicking the left arrow symbol. They are then available in the left box again.

INSERT_SCREENSHOT (some results, one or two selected)

In our example, we would look for all connections X has in the DB and get all the associated persons. The final visualization would include X and all connected persons.
